# Sets
* Bunch of elements/members 
* Represent using Capital letters

## Rules
* Member cannot be repeated
```
A = {1,2,2,3} 
```
* Order of member does not matter
```
{1,2,3} = {2,1,3}
```
## Notation
### Roster Notation
```
A = {1,2,3,4,5}
```
### Set-builder Notation
```
A = {x|x is integer between 1 and 5}
```
## Examples
* A is a set with members 1,2,3,4,5
```
A = {1,2,3,4,5}
B = {2,4,6,8}
```
* 3 is member of set A
```
3 Ⲉ A 
```
### Combining sets

* Intersection
```
A 𝉅 B = {2,4}
A 𝉅 B = {x|x ∈ A Λ x ∈ B}
```
* Union
```
A 𝈱 B = {1,2,3,4,5,6,8}
A 𝈱 B = {x|x ∈ A V x ∈ B}
```
* Difference (for understanding A − B)
```
A \ B = {x|x ∈ A Λ x ∉ B}
A \ B = {1,3,5}
```
* Symmetric Difference
```
A Δ B = {}
A Δ B = {x|x ∈ A ⊕ x ∈ B}
A Δ B = A \ B 𝈱 B \ A
```
### Logical Operators
* Conjunction (And)
```
Λ
```
* Disjunction (Or)
```
V
```
* XOR
```
⊕
```
