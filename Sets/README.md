# Sets
* Bunch of elements/members 
* Represent using Capital letters

## Rules
* Member cannot be repeated
```
A = {1,2,2,3} 
```
* Order of member does not matter
```
{1,2,3} = {2,1,3}
```
## Notation
### Roster Notation
```
A = {1,2,3,4,5}
```
### Set-builder Notation
```
A = {x|x is integer between 1 and 5}
```
## Examples
* A is a set with members 1,2,3,4,5
```
A = {1,2,3,4,5}
```
* 3 is member of set A
```
3 â²ˆ A 
```
* Combining sets
```
