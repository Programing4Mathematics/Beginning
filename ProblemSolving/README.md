# Problem Solving

### What is Problem?
* Math in not a Problem
* Reading assessment = Word problem
* Translating it into arithmetic
* Doing computations
* Getting the correct answer

### What is a Good Problem?
* engage students' intellect
* stimulate students to <b>make connections </b> and develop a coherent framework for <b> mathematical reasoning</b>
* based on <b>knowledge</b> of the range of ways that diverse students learn mathematics

### Phases of Problem Solving

1. Entry Phase

  * What do I know?

    * Reading the question
    * Past experience

  * What do I want?

    * Write the problem in your own words.
    * Watch out for possible ambiguities.
    * Don't make assumption

  * What can I introduce?

    * Make a diagram
    * Write in mathematical notation
    * Think outside box

2. Attack Phase

  * Brute Force

    * Four color theorem

  * Clever Strategy

    * Pattern recognition

3. Review Phase

  * Check

    * Make sure your solution actually works.

  * Reflect
    * What were the big realizations?

  * Extend
    * Generalization

  * Caution!
    * Patterns can be misleading
